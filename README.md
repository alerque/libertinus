Libertinus fonts
================

![Sample of Libertinus fonts](documentation/preview.svg)

The Libertinus fonts project is a fork of the
[Linux Libertine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Libertine) and Linux Biolinum fonts.
It started as an OpenType math companion of the Libertine font family,
and has grown to a full fork to address some of the bugs in the fonts.
Thanks to Frédéric Wang for coming up with the name Libertinus.

Libertinus was forked from the
[5.3.0 (2012-07-02) release](https://sourceforge.net/projects/linuxlibertine/files/linuxlibertine/)
of Linux Libertine fonts.

The family consists of:

* Libertinus Serif: forked from *Linux Libertine*.
* Libertinus Sans: forked from *Linux Biolinum*.
* Libertinus Mono: forked from *Linux Libertine Mono*.
* Libertinus Math: an OpenType math font for use in OpenType math-capable
  applications (like LuaTeX, XeTeX or MS Word 2007+).

Libertinus fonts are available under the terms of the Open Font License version
1.1.

A zip file containing the font files can be downloaded from the 
“[Releases](https://github.com/alif-type/libertinus/releases)” page
of the project on GitHub.

See the [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) file
for instructions on how to build the fonts and contribute any changes.
