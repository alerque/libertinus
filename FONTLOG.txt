FONTLOG for Libertinus
---------------------

This file provides detailed information on the Libertinus font software. This
information should be distributed along with the Libertinus fonts and any
derivative works.


Basic Font Information
----------------------

Libertinus fonts is a fork of the Linux Libertine and Linux Biolinum fonts that
started as an OpenType math companion of the Libertine font family, but grown
as a full fork to address some of the bugs in the fonts.

The family consists of:

* Libertinus Serif: forked from *Linux Libertine*.
* Libertinus Sans: forked from *Linux Biolinum*.
* Libertinus Mono: forked from *Linux Libertinus Mono*.
* Libertinus Math: an OpenType math font for use in OpenType math-capable
  applications like LuaTeX, XeTeX or MS Word 2007+.

Libertinus development is currently hosted on:
https://github.com/alif-type/libertinus

Feature requests, bug reports and patches should be directed to our issue
tracker.
