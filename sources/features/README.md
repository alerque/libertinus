# GSUB Features

This directory contains the authoritative source files for GSUB features in
the Sans, Serif, and SerifDisplay faces. The `.fea` file corresponding to 
each face can be generated by typing `make feature-files` at the top-level. 
`make normalize` will delete any existing GSUB tables in the fonts and merge
the generated feature file, and `make check` will verify that merging does
not change its content.

The files are processed with the `preprocess` command, which is a dependency
documented in the top-level README.
